      <h2>Why did you make this site?</h2>
      <p>I wanted to add a project to my portfolio, and a topster site was one of several ideas I kicked around for a while. I finally got around to it one night. Just a couple hours after I sat down to start coding, the creator of another well-known topster site added a link to a sketchy website, which made a lot of people start looking for an alternative. That coincidence certainly pushed me to commit to finishing Topsters.org, but it was only a coincidence. My decision to create this site was personal interest and not a response to anything.</p>
      <h2>Why is book searching slow, why does it sometimes not work, why is it missing a book, etc.?</h2>
      <p>I'm using OpenLibrary, which is affiliated with the Internet Archive and runs on donations. The music and games APIs are both from companies that can afford top-tier reliability. But OpenLibrary is a bit less reliable. Don't judge them too much for it, and maybe <a href="https://archive.org/donate/?platform=ol&origin=olwww-TopNavDonateButton">donate to them</a> to help them improve their services.</p>
      <h2>How can I make my own topster site or similar project?</h2>
      <p>If you're a developer, you might be interested in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/topster">JavaScript library I made</a>. Topsters 3 uses this to generate charts, and your project can too.</p>
      <h2>Why is my favorite album/book/game not in the results?</h2>
      <p>Not everything in the databases has cover art attached. Because charts require cover art, Topsters 3 filters out items that are missing it. For example, occasionally a band decides they don't want their cover art to appear in databases anymore, so they file a copyright takedown. You may have seen this happen on other sites such as Rate Your Music. This is very rare but it can affect popular items--as of this writing, all of King Crimson's releases are missing album art on Last.fm and as a result will not appear in search results.</p>
