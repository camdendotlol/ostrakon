    <h3>Why can't I find any King Crimson albums?</h3>
    <p>Not everything in the databases has cover art attached. Because charts require cover art, Topsters 3 filters out items that are missing it. For example, occasionally a band decides they don't want their cover art to appear in databases anymore, so they file a copyright takedown. You may have seen this happen on other sites such as Rate Your Music. This is very rare but it can affect popular items--as of this writing, all of King Crimson's releases are missing album art on Last.fm and as a result will not appear in search results.</p>
    <h3>Why is book searching slow, why does it sometimes not work, why is it missing a book, etc.?</h3>
    <p>I'm using OpenLibrary, which is affiliated with the Internet Archive and runs on donations. The music and games APIs are both from companies that can afford top-tier reliability. But OpenLibrary is a bit less reliable. Don't judge them too much for it, and maybe <a href="https://archive.org/donate/?platform=ol&origin=olwww-TopNavDonateButton">donate to them</a> to help them improve their services.</p>
    <h3>What is "Ubuntu Mono"?</h3>
    <p>In the past, Topsters 3 downloaded the Ubuntu Mono font from Google Fonts and set it as the default font for new charts. Although I think Ubuntu Mono is a nice font, removing it from Topsters 3 will make the site a bit lighter and will slightly improve load times.</p>
    <h3>Where can I donate?</h3>
    <p>This site is cheap to run so donations would just complicate things.</p>
