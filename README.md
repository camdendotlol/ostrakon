## Contributing

I'm happy to accept contributions for anything in the list of issues. Please leave a comment when you begin to work on an issue so no one else duplicates your work.

If you want to change something not listed in the issues, open an issue to propose it. For the most part I'm not interested in big design changes, but I'm always open to new item categories, performance improvements, or other bug fixes.

Keep in mind that this project started as a personal portfolio project when I had very little programming experience. The code isn't very professional and there's a lot of room for improvement. This was also my first, and so far only, Vue project. Feedback and contributions from Vue experts would be greatly appreciated.
